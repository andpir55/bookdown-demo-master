abstract = {Heavy migration patterns, the globalization of markets, and increased cross-cultural communications have made cross-cultural research a necessity in the behavioral and social sciences. In "Methods and Data Analysis for Cross-Cultural Research," the authors have developed a guide for graduate students and professionals that presents cross-cultural methodology in a practical light. The central focus is primarily on the design and analysis of quasi-experiments, which is the dominant framework for cross-cultural research. This volume presents an overview of tools of cross-cultural research and illustrates the most meaningful techniques in feature boxes, complete with sample data.  This guide will be of interest to researchers in the fields of clinical/counseling psychology, social work, research methods, sociology, ethnic studies, and social psychology.

In the future, most cross-cultural studies will be carried out by researchers who have an interest in cultural variations on specific variables or instruments.

Bias and equivalence have become the common terms to refer to the issue. Taxonomy of both bias and equivalence is presented. Bias can be engendered by the theoretical construct (construct bias), the method such as the form of test administration (method bias), and the item content (item bias). Equivalence refers to the measurement level at which scores can be compared across cultures. Three levels of equivalence are possible: the same construct is measured in each cultural group but the functional form of the relationship between scores obtained in various groups is unknown (structural equivalence), scores have the same measurement unit across populations but have different origins (measurement unit equivalence), and scores have the same measurement unit and origin in all populations (full scale equivalence). The most frequently encountered sources of bias and their remedies are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

It shows that the scale on which the index is measured is noninvariant across cultural zones and countries in the World Values Survey. In addition, it demonstrates that the current index composition mixes different value dimensions and their actual associations with various political outcomes, in particular the index of effective democracy. However, an analysis using a novel approximate Bayesian approach shows that at least one specific subdimension of emancipative values, known as pro-choice values, truly exists and may be validly measured and compared cross-nationally. The article also contributes to the recent discussion on whether emancipative values are a reflective or a formative construct by providing thought experiments and empirical evidence supporting the former interpretation.},

@incollection{DeBeuckelaer2011,
abstract = {Making valid comparisons of latent variable (LV) mean scores across groups is anything but a trivial task as it relies on stringent measurement invariance conditions. There is a growing need for research to help understand the sensitivity of the analytical procedures when making cross-cultural comparisons (e.g., multigroup mean and covariance structure, i.e., multigroup MACS) analysis, and the extent to which less stringent measurement invariance conditions (if unnoticed) can affect latent variable (LV) mean comparisons across groups. One way to adequately explore the extent to which the requirement of scalar invariance can be relaxed (without threatening the validity of cross-group comparisons) is to make use of carefully designed simulation research. Such simulation research may (at least potentially) provide valuable empirical evidence to justify the adoption of less stringent measurement invariance conditions. Except for an older study by Kaplan and George that did not include invariance conditions relating to indicator intercepts, we did not find any published simulation study that enables us to infer to what degree the measurement invariance conditions across groups can be relaxed without running the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions from cross-group comparisons of LV mean scores. In this chapter, we will try to fill this gap in the literature by presenting a simulation study that investigates the extent to which noninvariance of factor loadings and indicator intercepts may lead to false statistical conclusions in terms of (the reported significance of) LV mean differences across groups. The next sections will elaborate on the method of research and the analysis strategy, the presentation of some detailed results, and the general conclusions.

abstract = {Measurement invariance with respect to groups is an essential aspect of the fair use of scores of intelligence tests and other psychological measurements. It is widely believed that equal factor loadings are sufficient to establish measurement invariance in confirmatory factor analysis. Here, it is shown why establishing measurement invariance with confirmatory factor analysis requires a statistical test of the equality over groups of measurement intercepts. Without this essential test, measurement bias may be overlooked. A re-analysis of a study by Te Nijenhuis, Tolboom, Resing, and Bleichrodt (2004) on ethnic differences on the RAKIT IQ test illustrates that ignoring intercept differences may lead to the conclusion that bias of IQ tests with respect to minorities is small, while in reality bias is quite severe. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.},

abstract = {Psychology has become less WEIRD in recent years, marking progress toward becoming a truly global psychology. However, this increase in cultural diversity is not matched by greater attention to cultural biases in research. A significant challenge in culture-comparative research in psychology is that any comparisons are open to possible item bias and non-invariance. Unfortunately, many psychologists are not aware of problems and their implications, and do not know how to best test for invariance in their data. We provide a general introduction to invariance testing and a tutorial of three major classes of techniques that can be easily implemented in the free software and statistical language R. Specifically, we describe (1) confirmatory and multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, with extension to exploratory structural equation modeling, and multi-group alignment; (2) iterative hybrid logistic regression as well as (3) exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis with Procrustes rotation. We pay specific attention to effect size measures of item biases and differential item function. Code in R is provided in the main text and online (see https://osf.io/agr5e/), and more extended code and a general introduction to R are available in the Supplementary Materials.},

@book{Brown2015,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Assessing the applicability of frameworks developed in one country to other countries is an important step in establishing the generalizability of consumer behavior theories. In order for such comparisons to be meaningful, however, the instruments used to measure the theoretical constructs of interest have to exhibit adequate cross-national equivalence. We review the various forms of measure- ment invariance that have been proposed in the literature, organize them into a coherent conceptual framework that ties different requirements of measure equivalence to the goals of the research, and propose a practical, sequential testing procedure for assessing measurement invariance in cross-national con- sumer research. The approach is based on multisample confirmatory factor analy- sis and clarifies under what conditions meaningful comparisons of construct con- ceptualizations, construct means, and relationships between constructs are possible. An empirical application dealing with the single-factor construct of con- sumer ethnocentrism in Belgium, Great Britain, and Greece is provided to illustrate the procedure.},

@book{Millsap2011,
abstract = {I have written this book with several goals in mind. The first goal is to acquaint the reader with the broad set of statistical procedures currently used to approach the problem of detecting measurement bias. A second goal, which follows upon the first, is to provide the necessary background material so that readers can place the many detection procedures in context. Toward that end, the book devotes considerable space to describing the measurement models that underlie psychometric practice. I have also included some theoretical results that subsume many types of detection procedures, showing their strengths and limitations. Finally, I hope that the book will inspire more researchers to become involved in bias detection research. The problem of detecting bias in psychological measures is a difficult one, and it represents a significant challenge to measurement in psychology. In addition to the detection problem itself, the measurement bias problem has implications for the use of tests in many domains as predictors or as tools for making decisions about people. The last chapter of the book explores these implications for the use of tests in prediction and for the related problem of bias in prediction. The intended audience for this book consists of researchers and students who wish to understand the array of available procedures for detecting bias in psychological measurement. The problem of measurement bias arises in many research settings, ranging from applied research in employment or educational testing to the use of tests or questionnaires in experimental studies with multiple groups. I hope that the book will serve as a useful reference for researchers in all of these settings. The book is intended to also serve as a resource for students who want to learn more about psychometrics, particularly in relation to the problem of measurement bias as a challenge to the validity of measurement. To benefit from the book, a student should have an understanding of basic probability and statistical theory, along with some knowledge of regression. The overall structure of the book can be described as follows. Chapter 1 presents some basic information about the definition of measurement bias and how the book will examine this topic. Chapter 2 reviews the measurement models used in psychometric theory. Emphasis is placed on latent variable models, with introductions to classical test theory, factor analysis, and item response theory, along with the controversies associated with each. Measurement invariance and bias in the context of multiple populations is defined in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the common factor model for continuous measures in multiple populations and its use in the investigation of factorial invariance. It examines identification problems in confirmatory factor analysis along with estimation and fit evaluation and provides an example using WAIS-R data. The factor analysis model for discrete measures in multiple populations with an emphasis on the specification, identification, estimation, and fit evaluation issues is addressed in Chapter 5. An MMPI example is also provided. Chapter 6 reviews both dichotomous and polytomous item response models emphasizing estimation methods and model fit evaluations. The use of models in item response theory in evaluating invariance across multiple populations is then described in Chapter 7, including an example that uses data from a large-scale achievement test. Chapter 8 examines item bias evaluation methods that use observed scores to match individuals and provides an example that uses the same achievement test data from the previous chapter. Finally, the book concludes with Chapter 9, which discusses the implications of measurement bias for the use of tests in prediction, as in educational or employment settings.
