* Measurement invariance is important

* Comparisons based on single questions without knowledge of the equivalence can be questioned

* Adapt the measurement testing procedure to the model you want to test

* Don't think about measurement invariance only when you get the data: 

> **Think about measurement invariance and actively include it during questionnaire design**
  
* Remember MGCFA needs at least 3 indicators per latent variable to test for it.
  
* Compare distributions and look for substantial deviations of the equality constraints over groups for slopes (factor loadings) and intercepts

* Equivalent loadings (metric invariance) necessary for correlations, regressions 

* Equivalent intercepts (scalar invariance) necessary for comparing latent means 

* Comparing means and relationships between latent variables across countries does not have to require perfect invariance.
